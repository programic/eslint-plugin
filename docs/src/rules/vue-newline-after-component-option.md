> Enforce exactly one newline after every Vue component option

- :hammer: This rule is automatically fixable.
- :information_source: This rule only works when using the Options API

## :book: Rule details
This rule enforces exactly one newline after every Vue component option (like `components`, `data`, `computed` etc.), so you have a better overview of the different sections of your component's script tag.

## :gear: Options
Nothing.
